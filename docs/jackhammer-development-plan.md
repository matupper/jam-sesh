# Jackhammer IDE Development Plan

## Overview

This development plan provides a detailed, incremental approach to building Jackhammer IDE - a Visual Studio Code fork that integrates AWS Bedrock AI capabilities. The plan focuses on delivering value quickly through small, testable increments while maintaining a clear path toward the full MVP.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Start Small**: Begin with the simplest possible integration that demonstrates value
2. **Test Early**: Each increment should be testable independently
3. **User Focus**: Prioritize features that directly improve developer productivity
4. **AWS-First**: Leverage AWS services and best practices throughout
5. **Incremental Value**: Each phase should deliver tangible value to users

- Error handling
- Integration points

### Integration Testing
Regular integration testing should verify:
- AWS authentication flow
- Model selection and inference
- Context gathering across files
- UI responsiveness and state management

### User Testing
Periodic user testing sessions should focus on:
- Developer workflow integration
- Response quality and relevance
- Performance with real-world codebases
- Overall user experience

## Deployment Process

### Internal Testing
1. Daily builds for development team
2. Weekly builds for internal testers
3. Bug tracking and prioritization

### Alpha Release
1. Limited distribution to select power users
2. Focus on core functionality feedback
3. Weekly updates based on critical findings

### Beta Release
1. Wider distribution to early adopters
2. Complete MVP functionality
3. Bi-weekly updates with fixes and improvements

### Public Release
1. Full distribution via chosen channels
2. Complete documentation and support
3. Regular update schedule established

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:
1. Users can authenticate with AWS Bedrock
2. The GenAI chat panel works reliably with all Bedrock models
3. Code context is properly integrated into prompts
4. Basic code assistance (generation, explanation, improvement) functions correctly
5. The system works with projects of realistic size and complexity

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **VS Code API Changes**: Monitor upstream VS Code changes and adjust accordingly
- **AWS API Changes**: Implement version checking and compatibility layers
- **Performance Issues**: Establish performance benchmarks and optimization strategies

### Product Risks
- **User Adoption**: Gather continuous feedback and prioritize UX improvements
- **Competing Products**: Regularly analyze competitor features and differentiation
- **AWS Limitations**: Maintain fallback options for AWS service disruptions

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a clear, incremental path to building the Jackhammer IDE MVP with AWS Bedrock integration. By focusing on small, valuable increments and regular testing, we can deliver a high-quality product while managing development risks effectively. The phased approach ensures we can validate our assumptions at each step and adjust our course as needed.
