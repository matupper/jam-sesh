# Jackhammer IDE: Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Jackhammer is an IDE built on a Visual Studio Code fork that integrates AWS Bedrock's generative AI capabilities directly into the development workflow. Unlike Cursor (which uses proprietary AI models), Jackhammer will allow developers to leverage the full range of foundation models available through AWS Bedrock, plus additional AWS AI services like Knowledge Bases, Agents, and other tools. This approach provides greater model flexibility, enterprise-grade security, and tighter integration with existing AWS infrastructure.

## Product Vision

Jackhammer will be the premier IDE for developers who want to:
- Use AWS Bedrock's foundation models for code assistance
- Maintain data privacy and security through AWS's enterprise compliance features
- Integrate development workflows with existing AWS infrastructure and services
- Customize AI behavior using their own fine-tuned models and knowledge bases

## User Personas

### Primary: Enterprise Developer
- Works in regulated industries with strict data governance
- Already uses AWS infrastructure and services
- Needs customizable AI assistance that respects security boundaries

### Secondary: AWS AI Developer
- Builds applications with AWS Bedrock and related services
- Wants to test AI capabilities directly in their development environment
- Requires access to the full range of AWS AI services for development
